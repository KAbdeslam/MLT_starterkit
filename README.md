# MLT Starter Kit

## Overview
**Mission: Democratizing Machine Learning.**

MLT is a non-profit group of Machine Learning Engineers and Researchers and a community of 2000 people in Tokyo, Japan. Our mission is to create, grow and sustain an inclusive, collaborative and engineering focused environment. We facilitate opportunities to study, teach and build Artificial Intelligence projects, including Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Science and Robotics.

## How to join MLT
**MLT Community Members:** Anyone can become part of the Machine Learning Tokyo community by joining one of our online platforms:

- Meetup: https://meetup.com/Machine-Learning-Tokyo/ (updates on workshops and events)
- Slack: https://machinelearningtokyo.slack.com/ (community chat)
- Discourse: http://discuss.mltokyo.ai (sharing and archiving projects)

You don't necessarily have to be located in Tokyo to join MLT. We provide online videos, code and resources on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88RC_4egFjV9jfjBHwDuvg) and [GitHub](https://github.com/Machine-Learning-Tokyo).

**MLT Core Team:** The MLT Core Team currently consists of 10 volunteer members in Tokyo: 8 ML Engineers/Researchers, 1 Roboticist, 1 Web Dev. We are in charge of technical workshops, paper readings, online resources, working sessions, study groups and building specific ML projects. We are currently looking to expand the core team in the following areas:

- Operations
- Partnerships
- Social Media & Community Management
- Engineering: Machine Learning, Full Stack SWE, Front-end Web Dev/UI/UX

If you are interested in Artificial Intelligence and would like to gain professional experience, grow your skills and contribute to the ML community at the same time please get in touch, we'd be more than happy to share more info.
